### Hello world, I'm [Binh Nguyen](http://xubi.me/)! 

Welcome to my world of innovation, where I turn complex ideas into game-changing solutions!

As an accomplished IT professional with a strong background in ERP and Accounting SaaS development, I've honed my skills over the course of a decade. During this time, I've gained invaluable expertise in strategic planning, budgeting, forecasting, people management, product development, project scope, and change management processes.

My true passion, however, lies in revolutionizing the financial industry. As the CEO and Head of Product at Angel Technology Investment JSC, I'm leading the development of a groundbreaking finance platform called TaxBook. Our mission is simple - to empower individuals, self-employed professionals, and small businesses to achieve financial prosperity by earning more, saving time, and being confident in their financial decisions.

At Angel Technology Investment JSC, we're committed to leveraging the latest AI-driven technologies to solve our customers' most pressing problems. By connecting them with expert service providers offering tax advisory, accounting, and other related services, we're changing the game for good.

Before embarking on this exciting journey, I founded Xao Xao Digital - an ERP provider company based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Our focus was on developing automated systems that help businesses optimize costs, minimize risks, and streamline operations. During my tenure, I led over 100 successful projects, including collaborations with renowned brands like Thuocsi.vn (Buymed) and Lien Phat Corporation for Raffles Medical Vietnam.

Overall, I'm a dynamic leader with a keen eye for innovation and a passion for success. My exceptional leadership skills, deep understanding of the IT industry, and unwavering commitment to excellence make me an invaluable asset to any team.
